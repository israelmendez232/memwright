# [MEM-020] Backend Go Project Scaffolding

## Priority
High

## Story Points
3

## Description

The memwright backend requires initial Go project scaffolding before any API development can begin. Currently, the repository only contains documentation with no source code. This ticket establishes the foundational Go project structure in the `/api` directory, including module initialization, basic server setup, and configuration management.

The implementation follows idiomatic Go project layout conventions with `cmd/` for application entrypoints and `internal/` for private packages. The basic HTTP server will include a health endpoint for container orchestration readiness checks. Environment-based configuration enables different settings for development, staging, and production environments.

## Tasks

- [ ] Initialize Go module in /api with go.mod and create cmd/server/main.go with basic HTTP server (2 pts)
- [ ] Create internal/config/config.go for environment variable loading (1 pt)
- [ ] tests/ folder and basic validation, integration/ (with a basic health check) and unit/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Go module compiles without errors using `go build ./...`
- [ ] API health endpoint responds at http://localhost:8080/health
- [ ] Server reads configuration from environment variables
- [ ] Project structure follows Go standard layout conventions
- [ ] The initial unit tests and structure for the golang Project
