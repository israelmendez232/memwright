# [MEM-021] Frontend React Project Scaffolding

## Priority
High

## Story Points
2

## Description

The memwright frontend requires initial React project scaffolding before any UI development can begin. Currently, the repository only contains documentation with no source code. This ticket establishes the foundational React TypeScript project in the `/web` directory using Vite as the build tool for fast development iteration.

The implementation uses Vite with the React TypeScript template, providing hot module replacement and optimized production builds. The project will be configured with strict TypeScript settings and a clean folder structure ready for component development. This scaffolding enables parallel frontend work once completed.

## Tasks

- [ ] Initialize Vite React TypeScript project in /web using create-vite (1 pt)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled (1 pt)
- [ ] tests/ folder and basic validation, integration/ (with a basic health check) and unit/

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] React app renders without errors in the browser
- [ ] Web dev server runs at http://localhost:5173
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with strict mode
- [ ] Hot module replacement works during development
- [ ] Production build generates optimized static assets
- [ ] The initial unit tests and structure for the golang Project
