# [MEM-022] Docker Compose and Makefile Setup

## Priority

## Story Points

## Description

The memwright project requires Docker Compose orchestration and a Makefile for standardized development commands. This ticket creates the infrastructure layer that ties together the PostgreSQL database, Go API, and React frontend into a cohesive local development environment. This setup ensures all developers have a consistent experience regardless of their local machine configuration.

The implementation uses Docker Compose to define and run multi-container services with proper networking and volume mounts. The Makefile provides a simple interface for common operations like starting services, running tests, building artifacts, and managing database migrations. Hot-reload is enabled for both API and web services during development.

## Tasks

- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL, API, and web services (2 pts)
- [ ] Create Makefile with dev, test, build, and migrate targets (1 pt)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Running `make dev` starts all three services (db, api, web)
- [ ] PostgreSQL is accessible at localhost:5432 with configured credentials
- [ ] API container builds and runs the Go server
- [ ] Web container runs Vite dev server with hot reload
- [ ] `make test` runs tests for both api and web
- [ ] `make build` creates production-ready artifacts
- [ ] Services can communicate via Docker network
